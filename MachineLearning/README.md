# Machine Learning

Machine learning is the hottest field in data science, and this track will get you started quickly.

Wepage of the main course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning

## How this page works

So what I'm doing here is answering all the questions they ask for each level, and creating a notebook with the solutions using both Pandas and Apache Spark (mostly through [Optimus](https://github.com/ironmussa/Optimus)).

Any contribute notebook should be added with a PR and inside the folder contrib.

## Notebooks

1. [How models work](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FavioVazquez/kaggle-learning/blob/master/MachineLearning/01_how_models_work.ipynb)

2. [First Level](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FavioVazquez/kaggle-learning/blob/master/MachineLearning/first_level.ipynb)
